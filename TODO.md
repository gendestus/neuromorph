Classes
    RelationalDB - Wrapper for relational access...can be abstracted to support additional databases
    VectorDB - Wrapper for vector access
    Thinker - Generates thoughts on how it should proceed given an observation, recent memories, relevant memories, and core memories
        - Entry Point: def observe(obersation: Observation) -> Thought
    Doer - Takes a thought generated by the Thinker and comes up with an action to take
        - Entry Point: def execute(thought: Thought) -> list(Action)



Some Notes
    - Actions should go into a queue to get executed so that the thinker can come up with a complex plan
    - Introspection loop must come after intial memories are setup
    - Need a mechanism to judge and retain core memories
        

Setup
    - Relational DB
    - Persistent Vector Store
