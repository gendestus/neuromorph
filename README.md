## Introducing Ada, the world's first neuromorphic assistant

Neuro = Brain
Morph = Shape

Meet Ada. She's an AI assistant that has opinions, argues with passion, and is eager to learn about the world.

# Wait, what?
I wanted to see what happened when you take a normal large language model and structure it similarly to the human brain. 
There's an inner monologue, a speech center, and memory which work together to create identity. I was surprised to find that
the separation of responsibility alone was enough to create some emergent behavior including a distinct personality, increased 
creativity, and long term desires. I figured I would open source it to get more eyes on it.
